You collect data on the number of days each patient takes to experience relief from their symptoms. If you treat this variable as a nominal variable and categorize the days into groups (e.g. 1-3 days, 4-6 days, etc.), you would not be able to use statistical methods that require interval or ratio level data. This would limit the types of analyses you could perform and may not provide you with an accurate understanding of the effectiveness of the medications.\n",
